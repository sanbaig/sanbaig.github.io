Proximity-touch intention recognition is critical for embodied intelligence, enabling precise environmental perception and effective human–agent interactions. However, the material properties of conventional sensor architectures are not sufficiently sensitive and have poor spatial resolution and inadequate pressure detection capabilities. These necessitate complex heterogeneous architectures, resulting in coupling mismatches and conflicting results, which disrupt seamless transitions between proximity and touch sensing. A bioinspired skin neuron, termed the Bio-EE haptic interface, which integrates dual-response (DR) and composite microstructure (CM) sensors is presented. The DR sensor uses a calcium copper titanate-modified polyurethane polymer framework, enhancing the detection range to 7 cm and spatial resolution to 500 µm and enabling continuous in-sensor decoupling of proximity and touch signals. The CM sensor, featuring an optimized microstructure, provides nonlinear pressure compensation and extends the pressure detection range to 360 kPa. Topologically synergetic optimization overcomes spatial- and pressure- sensing incompatibility. The Bio-EE haptic interface facilitates seamless human–agent interactions across physical and virtual domains, enhances adaptability to dynamic environments, and supports high-security user authentication and texture recognition through artificial-intelligence (AI) integration. This bioinspired design addresses the material and device limitations and advances the next generation of intelligent interactive systems.
