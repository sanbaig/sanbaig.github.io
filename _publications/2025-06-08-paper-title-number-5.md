For accurate intent recognition and differential decision making in dynamic interactive scenarios, a scenario-adaptive interactive interface with touch features and external factor-perceiving capability is essential. However, existing interactive interfaces based on discrete array structures are constrained by excessive data redundancy, sensing-computing separation, and external factor insensitivity. In this study, an intelligent interactive interface for multimodal synergistic cognition (MSC), which adopts a signal linear partition strategy with spatiotemporal encoding, and innovatively enables the addressable perception and fusion of multimodal features within only one channel. Designing a heterogeneous transconductance structure, the MSC interactive interface mimics the multidimensional amplitude weighting and event-driven logic of the biological stimulation gating mechanism, achieving multipoint and wide-range (0.8–250 kPa) tactile decoding and external-factor-based intent correction in complex scenarios. Owing to cuttability and topological reconfiguration, the MSC interactive interface promotes the form generalization of interactive entities and facilitates intelligent learning (accuracy > 99%) of unstructured features. The demonstration of touch-strain-driven robotic arm control highlights the importance of touch cognitive alignment with external factors in non-predefined scenes. This study promotes the transition of intelligent machines from passive response to differentiable cognition with external-factor enhancement, providing a foundational approach to a triadic cognitive framework integrating touch, machine, and external factors.
