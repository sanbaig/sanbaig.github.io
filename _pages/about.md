**Modular Tactile Sensors for Cut-and-Paste Interaction** (Corresponding to Paper 1)	
- Developed a spray-heating continuous high-throughput fabrication system; optimized deposition through COMSOL to achieve uniform conductive film coatings and stable large-scale sensor production.
- Designed an ultrathin, symmetric double-layer sensor enabling cut-and-paste Interaction, whose stable and consistent fabrication allows replacement without calibration.
- Developed multiple interactive systems, including smart hat, bottle and bracelet, by integrating designed PCBs and Unity interaction scenes, forming a complete tactile sensing and real-time feedback platform.

**Visual-Tactile Cross-Modal Fusion Systems** (Corresponding to Paper 2)	
- Built a vision–tactile fusion piano system powered by YOLOv5, enabling autonomous score reading, robotic performance, and volume control.
- Designed a vision–tactile fusion system integrating YOLOv5 visual features and 1D CNN tactile signals, optimizing recognition performance for visually similar objects with improved accuracy and robustness.

**Multimodal Sensing Technology Based on Signal Linear Encoding** (Corresponding to Paper 3)	
- Designed a tactile interaction system capable of detecting both touch position and pressure, enabling real-time 3D model control in Unity without the need for cameras or complex wiring.

**Composite Structures for Distance Detection in Tactile Sensors** (Corresponding to Paper 4)	
- Built an embodied sensing network integrated with Unity classroom scene to enable diverse virtual interactions, and designed a proximity-based contactless presentation control system.
- Completed PCB design and embedded development, and created a closed haptic loop by integrating a Unity-based combat scene with thermal feedback that delivers heat sensations upon character hits.
